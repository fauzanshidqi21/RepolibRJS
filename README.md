README.md Generator

    Readme.md generator is a React application that takes basic information about the user's project as an input and generates a README file which the user can upload directly in their project's repository.

General Information

    For people who are starting and uploading their very first project on a GitHub repository, are often unaware about the importance of a README file. A README file is very important for a user to justify their work and also for other people who are trying to understand their project.

    They are not familiar with the syntax and rules of the markdown language to create and edit their markdown files on GitHub. As a result, they often avoid making one and just upload their projects without a README file.

    To solve this issue, we made a React application that will take in the basic information about the user's GitHub project and create a README file for them that they can upload directly in their project's repository.
